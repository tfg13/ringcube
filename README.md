A standalone alarm clock for the 21 century

While everybody seems to use a smartphone to get up in the morning, I still prefer a dedicated alarm clock.
Since no available alarm clock matched all my requirements, I decided to build my own.

Requirements:

* Solar powered
* Long standby time (in the dark)
* Play music from SD card
* Dedicated "+8h" quickset alarm time button
* Warn before the battery runs out (the old one failed to do this)
* Radio controlled
